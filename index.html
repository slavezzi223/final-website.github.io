            <p class="artist-statement">
                I am an artist who works in media such as: Printmaking, Graphic Design, and Photography. In my body of
                work I will always attempt to give a voice to the voiceless. Within my work I am always trying to
                address some situation that needs more than words to express. I deal with challenging social norms and
                systematic forms of oppression that have become commonplace in America.
            </p>
            <p class="artist-statement">
                Within my work I have addressed issues such as: mental health, self acceptance, the never changing of
                the past but always changing future, homophobia, racism, and so much more. I make art without fear, I as
                a person
                have anxiety talking to people so when I need to express emotion I take to my art without fear. I want
                onlookers to question and look deeper when viewing my work. I want them to question their "norms" and
                see if they need to check their personal biases.
